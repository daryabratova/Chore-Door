## Playing Instructions
**1.** Hiding behind one of these doors is the ChoreBot.

**2.** Your mission is to open all of the doors without running into the ChoreBot.

**3.** If you manage to avoid the ChoreBot until you open the very last door, you win!

**4.** See if you can score a winning streak!
