# Chore Door - Online game :robot:

A simple game, where you need to avoid opening the door with a robot that wants you to do housework.

## General Info

This is my study project from a Codecademy course of web-development. By myself I rewrite some logic, make the website adaptive, and add a counter of scores.

## Demo

Demo is available [here](https://daryabratova.github.io/Chore-Door/src/).

## Technologies

- **JavaScript**
- **HTML**
- **CSS**

## Playing Instructions

**1.** Hiding behind one of these doors is the ChoreBot.

**2.** Your mission is to open all of the doors without running into the ChoreBot.

**3.** If you manage to avoid the ChoreBot until you open the very last door, you win!

**4.** See if you can score a winning streak!
